<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>The documents present in this folder will be compiled and set to an html file given an adequate set of options. This file is mostly for making it easier to produce articles. The post is configured from the YAML header as given above, and should be adequately interpreted by the website’s python/jinja template script. The contents must be typed in a pandoc’s markdown style</p>
<h1 id="article-fields">Article fields</h1>
<h2 id="title-author-and-date">Title, author and date</h2>
<p>These are the standard fields, and self-explanatory. It supports multiple authors, as exemplified above. The date means the first publish date.</p>
<h2 id="last-update-optional">Last update (optional)</h2>
<p>If an article becomes later updated, it’s interesting to let the readers to notice it. This option will be used to configure any useful changes.</p>
<h2 id="image">Image</h2>
<p>To enhance the webpage experience, it’s important to have some images that represent each post. This field contains the relative link to the adequate figure</p>
<h2 id="tags-optional">Tags (optional)</h2>
<p>To organize the articles and provide adequate categorization, it’s interesting to provide these tags. The website blog updater should create a report-like file containing all currently used tags and their respective usage counts. It would be nice to have a word cloud.</p>
<p><strong>Special tags</strong>: Some tags will be interpreted separately. In this way it becomes possible to convert several of the the website contents to posts. For example, the technical section can contain tutorials, examples and exercises. Any softwares that I’ve developed could have a separate web page.</p>
<h2 id="status-optional">Status (optional)</h2>
<p>Currently the article can have the following status: “draft” or “publish”. The draft status is important to neglect the associated article from the website until it’s ready to the publication stage. If this is not set as “draft”, the article will be considered as “publish” by default.</p>
<h2 id="language-optional">Language (optional)</h2>
<p>Any post can be written in different languages. The default is english “En”, but it may be written also in portuguese “Pt”.</p>
