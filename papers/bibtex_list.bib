  Abstract                 = {Optical vortices (OV) are usually associated to cylindrically symmetric light beams. However, they can have more general geometries that extends their applicability [1]. Since the usual characterization methods are not appropriate for OV with arbitrary shapes, we discuss in this work how the definitions of the classical orbital angular momentum and the topological charge can be used to retrieve these informations in the general case. The concepts discussed are experimentally demonstrated and may be specially useful in areas such as optical tweezers and plasmonics.},

  Abstract                 = {In this work we discuss how the classical orbital angular momentum (OAM) and topological charge (TC) of optical beams with arbitrary spatial phase profiles are related to the local winding density. An analysis for optical vortices (OV) with non-cylindrical symmetry is presented and it is experimentally shown for the first time that OAM and TC may have different values. The new approach also provides a systematic way to determine the uncertainties in measurements of TC and OAM of arbitrary OV.},

As proof-of-principle experiments, we generated vortex beams with the spatial shape of straight lines, corners, and triangles. Potential applications for shaped beams include selective excitation of plasmonic modes, geometrically tunable Bose-Einstein condensates, and optical tweezers.},

The beam width is characterized in this Letter in terms of the transverse irradiance moments (TIMs) that allow an accurate description of the beam interaction and propagation. TIMs are rigorously related to the paraxial beam propagation parameters, and it is also possible to consider elliptical and astigmatic beams. Experimental data with very good signal-to-noise ratio were obtained for the reference materials carbon disulfide and fused quartz.},

  Abstract                 = {The Scattered Light Imaging Method (SLIM) was applied to measure the nonlinear refractive index of scattering media. The measurements are based on the analysis of the side-view images of the laser beam propagating inside highly scattering liquid suspensions. Proof-of-principle experiments were performed with colloids containing silica nanoparticles that behave as light scatterers. The technique allows measurements with lasers operating with arbitrary repetition rate as well as in the single-shot regime. The new method shows advantages and complementarity with respect to the Z-scan technique which is not appropriate to characterize scattering media.},
