  Abstract                 = {Optical vortices (OV) are usually associated to cylindrically symmetric light beams. However, they can have more general geometries that extends their applicability [1]. Since the usual characterization methods are not appropriate for OV with arbitrary shapes, we discuss in this work how the definitions of the classical orbital angular momentum and the topological charge can be used to retrieve these informations in the general case. The concepts discussed are experimentally demonstrated and may be specially useful in areas such as optical tweezers and plasmonics.},

An analysis for optical vortices (OV) with non-cylindrical symmetry is presented and it is experimentally shown for the first time that OAM and TC may have different values. The new approach also provides a systematic way to determine the uncertainties in measurements of TC and OAM of arbitrary OV.},

  Abstract                 = {The Scattered Light Imaging Method (SLIM) was applied to measure the nonlinear refractive index of scattering media. The measurements are based on the analysis of the side-view images of the laser beam propagating inside highly scattering liquid suspensions. Proof-of-principle experiments were performed with colloids containing silica nanoparticles that behave as light scatterers. The technique allows measurements with lasers operating with arbitrary repetition rate as well as in the single-shot regime. The new method shows advantages and complementarity with respect to the Z-scan technique which is not appropriate to characterize scattering media.},

abstract = {We present in this paper a wave-coupled model (WCM) to describe the effective nonlinear (NL) optical response of transparent materials illuminated by strong light beams in conditions such that stimulated light scattering is relevant. At low intensities, the WCM indicates that the NL scattering behaves similarly to a third- and fifth-order polarization susceptibility. However, at sufficiently high intensities, NL light scattering will lead to highly nonperturbative effective NL refraction and NL absorption coefficients. This is an important remark, given that attempts to explain NL scattering contributions as a perturbative NL response from data obtained at low intensities will become discrepant from the data obtained at high intensities. As an application of the model, we show that the existing divergent interpretations of the carbon disulfide (CS2) NL response in the picosecond and femtosecond regimes by several authors are consistent with the WCM, which indicates a direction for future experiments that may clarify the present controversy.},

abstract = {We explore the effective nonlinear (NL) optical response of transparent materials illuminated by strong light beams. Two different setups were used to study the influence of the numerical aperture (NA) corresponding to the collecting lens on the measured coefficients in the open- and closed-aperture Z-scan transmittance. For that, we have reproduced experiments in CS_2 at 532 nm in the picosecond regime using the D4\sigma-Z-scan method. It is found that measurements of high-order NL coefficients are not possible after a limit defined by the self-focusing of light inside the cell, and that stimulated light scattering is not significant to explain alone the saturation behavior that occurs in the NL refraction measurements. Indications are given for future Z-scan-based experiments that may clarify the boundary conditions to be respected for the measurement.},

In  the  present  work  amicrocontroller-based magnetometer was built using a single nitrogen-vacancy defect in a nanodiamond.  The imple-mented nanomagnetometry method is simple and relies on the frequency modulation of the nitrogen-vacancy defectelectron spin resonance using square pulses of an externally applied magnetic field and employs a single microwavesource.  The developed system has a reasonable sensitivity of 4$\mu$T/âˆšHz and is able to measure magnetic field varia-tions in time around 4 mT/s.  This system was used for nanoimaging the inhomogeneous spatial magnetic field profileof a magnetized steel microwire, and a spatial magnetic field gradient of 13$\mu$T/ 63 nm was measured.  Besides itsusefulness for nanoscale imaging of magnetic fields, the present work can be of interest in the development of compactnanodiamond based magnetometers.},
