  journal = {Journal of Luminescence},

  abstract = {The high quantum efficiency and long lifetimes of upconverting rare-earth-doped systems make luminescence band spectral overlap a particularly common phenomenon,
   frequently associated with various excitation and relaxation pathways. While it is often considered challenging to experimentally distinguish such overlapping luminescent bands,
    herein it is proposed a new method based on the different spectral responses of those luminescent lines to the excitation power at a single pumping wavelength laser.
     A model for the population of the overlapping bands in terms of the pump laser power is considered and fitted for each measured wavelength, resulting in separated spectra for each pathway.
      The results obtained with the proposed method are considered with direct excitation measurements, showing the effectiveness and simplicity of the method in comparison with more traditional approaches.},

  title = {Observation and analysis of nonlinear scattering using the scattered-light imaging method},
  journal = {Physical Review A},

  abstract = {Optical phenomena like nonlinear absorption and nonlinear refraction are often determined through light transmittance techniques. 
  However, in turbid or resonant media, scattering may also significantly attenuate the laser beam, such that absorptive losses may be overestimated.
   Thus, while transmittance techniques are suitable to determine the power extinction, it is often difficult to characterize the contribution of nonlinear scattering in a sample.
    In this work we applied the scattered-light imaging method to discriminate the nonlinear extinction due to nonlinear absorption and nonlinear scattering contributions in a
     turbid medium constituted of TiO2 nanoparticles suspended in acetone. The single-shot method collects an image of the beam transverse profile evolution along the
      propagation axis inside the sample. It was observed that while the results obtained by the transmittance technique indicate the extinction coefficient
       (including scattering and absorption contributions), the results obtained with the scattered-light imaging method discriminate the contribution of each phenomenon.
        Therefore, the results of both approaches are complementary and allow a more complete characterization of turbid media.},

  journal = {{ACS} Applied Materials {\&}amp$\mathsemicolon$ Interfaces},

  abstract = {Whereas lanthanide-based upconverting particles are promising candidates for several micro- and nanothermometry applications, understanding spatially varying effects related to their internal dynamics
   and interactions with the environment near the surface remains challenging. To separate the bulk from the surface response, this work proposes and performs hyperspectral sample-scanning experiments to obtain
    spatially resolved thermometric measurements on single microparticles of NaYF4: Yb3+,Er3+. Our results showed that the particle's thermometric response depends on the excitation laser incidence position, 
    which may directly affect the temperature readout. Furthermore, it was noticed that even minor temperature changes (<1 K) caused by room temperature variations at the spectrometer CCD sensor used to record the
     luminescence signal may significantly modify the measurements. This work also provides some suggestions for building 2D thermal maps that shall be helpful for understanding surface-related effects in micro- 
     and nanothermometers using hyperspectral techniques. Therefore, the results presented herein may impact applications of lanthanide-based nanothermometers, as in the understanding of energy-transfer processes 
     inside systems such as nanoelectronic devices or living cells.},

  abstract = {While temperature measurements with nanometric spatial resolution can provide valuable information in several fields,
  most of the current literature using rare-earth based nanothermometers report ensemble-averaged data.
  Neglecting individual characteristics of each nanocrystal (NC) may lead to important inaccuracies in the temperature measurements.
  In this work, individual Yb3+/Er3+ codoped yttria NCs are characterized as nanothermometers when embedded in different environments
  (air, water and ethylene glycol) using the same 5 NCs in all measurements, applying the luminescence intensity ratio technique.
  The obtained results show that the nanothermometric behavior of each NC in water is equivalent to that in air,
  up to an overall brightness reduction related to a decrease in collected light. Also, it was observed that the thermometric parameters
  from each NC can be much more precisely determined than those from the "ensemble" equivalent to the set of 5 single NCs. The "ensemble"
  parameters have increased uncertainties mainly due to NC size-related variations, which we associate to differences in the surface/volume ratio.
  Besides the reduced parameter uncertainty, it was also noticed that the single-NC thermometric parameters are directly correlated to the NC brightness,
  with a dependence that is consistent with the expected variation in the surface/volume ratio. The relevance of surface effects also became
  evident when the NCs were embedded in ethylene glycol, for which a molecular vibrational mode can resonantly interact with the Er3+ ions electronic
  excited states used in the present experiments. The methods discussed herein are suitable for contactless on-site calibration of the NCs
  thermometric response. Therefore, this work can also be useful in the development of measurement and calibration protocols for several
  lanthanide-based nanothermometric systems.},

In  the  present  work  amicrocontroller-based magnetometer was built using a single nitrogen-vacancy defect in a nanodiamond.  The imple-mented nanomagnetometry method is simple and relies on the frequency modulation of the nitrogen-vacancy defectelectron spin resonance using square pulses of an externally applied magnetic field and employs a single microwavesource.  The developed system has a reasonable sensitivity of 4$\mu$T/√Hz and is able to measure magnetic field varia-tions in time around 4 mT/s.  This system was used for nanoimaging the inhomogeneous spatial magnetic field profileof a magnetized steel microwire, and a spatial magnetic field gradient of 13$\mu$T/ 63 nm was measured.

  abstract = {We observe and analyze formation, decay, and subsequent regeneration of ring-shaped clusters of (2+1)-dimensional spatial solitons (filaments) in a medium with cubic-quintic (focusing-defocusing) self-interaction and strong dissipative nonlinearity. The cluster of filaments, which remains stable over $\approx$ 17.5 Rayleigh lengths, is produced by the azimuthal modulational instability from a parent ring-shaped beam with embedded vorticity $l=1$. In the course of still longer propagation, the stability of the soliton cluster is lost under the action of nonlinear losses. The annular cluster is then spontaneously regenerated due to power transfer from the reservoir provided by the unsplit part of the parent vortex ring. Thus, a secondary interval of the robust propagation of the regenerated cluster is identified. The experiments use a laser beam (at wavelength 800 nm), built of pulses with temporal duration 150 fs, at the repetition rate of 1 kHz, propagating in a cell filled by liquid carbon disulfide. Numerical calculations, based on a modified nonlinear Schrödinger equation which includes the cubic-quintic refractive terms and nonlinear losses, provide results in close agreement with the experimental findings.},

At low intensities, the WCM indicates that the NL scattering behaves similarly to a third- and fifth-order polarization susceptibility. However, at sufficiently high intensities, NL light scattering will lead to highly nonperturbative effective NL refraction and NL absorption coefficients. This is an important remark, given that attempts to explain NL scattering contributions as a perturbative NL response from data obtained at low intensities will become discrepant from the data obtained at high intensities. As an application of the model, we show that the existing divergent interpretations of the carbon disulfide (CS2) NL response in the picosecond and femtosecond regimes by several authors are consistent with the WCM, which indicates a direction for future experiments that may clarify the present controversy.},

It is found that measurements of high-order NL coefficients are not possible after a limit defined by the self-focusing of light inside the cell, and that stimulated light scattering is not significant to explain alone the saturation behavior that occurs in the NL refraction measurements.
