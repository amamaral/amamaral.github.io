  abstract = {While temperature measurements with nanometric spatial resolution can provide valuable information in several fields,
  most of the current literature using rare-earth based nanothermometers report ensemble-averaged data.
  Neglecting individual characteristics of each nanocrystal (NC) may lead to important inaccuracies in the temperature measurements.
  In this work, individual Yb3+/Er3+ codoped yttria NCs are characterized as nanothermometers when embedded in different environments
  (air, water and ethylene glycol) using the same 5 NCs in all measurements, applying the luminescence intensity ratio technique.
  The obtained results show that the nanothermometric behavior of each NC in water is equivalent to that in air,
  up to an overall brightness reduction related to a decrease in collected light. Also, it was observed that the thermometric parameters
  from each NC can be much more precisely determined than those from the "ensemble" equivalent to the set of 5 single NCs. The "ensemble"
  parameters have increased uncertainties mainly due to NC size-related variations, which we associate to differences in the surface/volume ratio.
  Besides the reduced parameter uncertainty, it was also noticed that the single-NC thermometric parameters are directly correlated to the NC brightness,
  with a dependence that is consistent with the expected variation in the surface/volume ratio. The relevance of surface effects also became
  evident when the NCs were embedded in ethylene glycol, for which a molecular vibrational mode can resonantly interact with the Er3+ ions electronic
  excited states used in the present experiments. The methods discussed herein are suitable for contactless on-site calibration of the NCs
  thermometric response. Therefore, this work can also be useful in the development of measurement and calibration protocols for several
  lanthanide-based nanothermometric systems.},

abstract = {The  measurement  of  magnetic  properties  of  various  physical  systems  with  nanometric  spatial  resolution  raises  in-terest  in  areas  as  materials  science,  biotechnology  and  information  storage  and  processing.   In  the  present  work  amicrocontroller-based magnetometer was built using a single nitrogen-vacancy defect in a nanodiamond.  The imple-mented nanomagnetometry method is simple and relies on the frequency modulation of the nitrogen-vacancy defectelectron spin resonance using square pulses of an externally applied magnetic field and employs a single microwavesource.  The developed system has a reasonable sensitivity of 4$\mu$T/√Hz and is able to measure magnetic field varia-tions in time around 4 mT/s.  This system was used for nanoimaging the inhomogeneous spatial magnetic field profileof a magnetized steel microwire, and a spatial magnetic field gradient of 13$\mu$T/ 63 nm was measured.  Besides itsusefulness for nanoscale imaging of magnetic fields, the present work can be of interest in the development of compactnanodiamond based magnetometers.},

  abstract = {We observe and analyze formation, decay, and subsequent regeneration of ring-shaped clusters of (2+1)-dimensional spatial solitons (filaments) in a medium with cubic-quintic (focusing-defocusing) self-interaction and strong dissipative nonlinearity. The cluster of filaments, which remains stable over $\approx$ 17.5 Rayleigh lengths, is produced by the azimuthal modulational instability from a parent ring-shaped beam with embedded vorticity $l=1$. In the course of still longer propagation, the stability of the soliton cluster is lost under the action of nonlinear losses. The annular cluster is then spontaneously regenerated due to power transfer from the reservoir provided by the unsplit part of the parent vortex ring. Thus, a secondary interval of the robust propagation of the regenerated cluster is identified. The experiments use a laser beam (at wavelength 800 nm), built of pulses with temporal duration 150 fs, at the repetition rate of 1 kHz, propagating in a cell filled by liquid carbon disulfide. Numerical calculations, based on a modified nonlinear Schrödinger equation which includes the cubic-quintic refractive terms and nonlinear losses, provide results in close agreement with the experimental findings.},

  abstract = {Disordered media are often susceptible to optical damage even at low irradiation doses, since the correspond-ing microscopic structure may suffer from processes such as bleaching, chemical reactions, or morphologicalchanges. The disorder often introduces linear and nonlinear (NL) light scattering, and currently it is a challengeto  perform  single-shot  characterization  of  NL  refraction,  NL  absorption,  and  NL  scattering  using  the  morecommon NL transmittance techniques. This work discusses how the scattered light imaging method and D4σ techniques can be combined to characterize the NL optical constants of thick turbid media.

abstract = {We present in this paper a wave-coupled model (WCM) to describe the effective nonlinear (NL) optical response of transparent materials illuminated by strong light beams in conditions such that stimulated light scattering is relevant. At low intensities, the WCM indicates that the NL scattering behaves similarly to a third- and fifth-order polarization susceptibility. However, at sufficiently high intensities, NL light scattering will lead to highly nonperturbative effective NL refraction and NL absorption coefficients. This is an important remark, given that attempts to explain NL scattering contributions as a perturbative NL response from data obtained at low intensities will become discrepant from the data obtained at high intensities. As an application of the model, we show that the existing divergent interpretations of the carbon disulfide (CS2) NL response in the picosecond and femtosecond regimes by several authors are consistent with the WCM, which indicates a direction for future experiments that may clarify the present controversy.},

Two different setups were used to study the influence of the numerical aperture (NA) corresponding to the collecting lens on the measured coefficients in the open- and closed-aperture Z-scan transmittance. For that, we have reproduced experiments in CS_2 at 532 nm in the picosecond regime using the D4\sigma-Z-scan method. It is found that measurements of high-order NL coefficients are not possible after a limit defined by the self-focusing of light inside the cell, and that stimulated light scattering is not significant to explain alone the saturation behavior that occurs in the NL refraction measurements. Indications are given for future Z-scan-based experiments that may clarify the boundary conditions to be respected for the measurement.},
